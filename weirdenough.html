        <p>Weird Enough Productions is a comic company building a new world of stories that will change the one we live in. 
            In this project the team designed <a href="https://weirdenoughproductions.com/about/" class="underline-link">GET Media L.I.T.</a>  a platform that uses media literacy, digital literacy, and 
            student voices to awaken the hero in every classroom.

                <p>To design a learning platform that presents various media content types to students and teachers, and facilitate 
                    engagement with the content. Platform will be used in different contexts include use on a personal computer, and 
                    projected in a classroom for in-class activities.</p>

                    <p>I remember <a href="https://youtu.be/IojxNM3zd6M" class="underline-link">Tony</a> say at this at the very first kick-off meeting on this project. That sentence summarises the company’s 
                        ethos and served as a guiding principle for the entire design process. We wanted to build a platform that helped students 
                        discover new content and teachers facilitate learning around these pieces of content. To do this, in collaboration with a 
                        UX researcher, we drew user flows to get a better sense of the information architecture and through several rounds of 
                        wireframes decided on the layout of the platform.

                    <div class="gap-10"></div>
                    <p>
                            One of our main objectives was to effectively surface relevant content to users as the Weird Enough 
                            library (comics, videos, newspaper clippings, etc.) grows larger. We iterated through many different 
                            options and decided to tag each content piece with the related school subject. Next, we decided to 
                            curate playlists that bundled content around a theme. The third level was to allow users (mainly 
                            teachers) subscribe to these playlists and create playlists of their own as they prepared for lessons. 
                            Students would then be able to follow and learn along. This was important because initial research 
                            showed for the platform should be built around content.

                <div class="gap-10"></div>
                <p>
                        If we successfully created relevant content, presented it clearly and made discovery efficient, learning 
                        will likely become fun and enjoyable. But the bigger question was "How does fun translate to actual 
                        learning?". We needed to structure lessons around optimising for learning. Because the platform will plug 
                        in to classrooms in the school district, our starting point was to align lessons to Learning Standards. 
                        Exploring this challenge brought about two new additions to the flow: the Lesson Overview page and the 
                        Recap page. These will help to prep learners to pick up learning goals as they go through the content 
                        pieces in the lesson, and further explore the issues encountered, respectively.

            Working on this project was challenging but especially interesting because I had the opportunity to work with a small 
            distributed team, collaborating with the UX researcher, product owner and lead engineer to explore different directions 
            and evaluate the pros and cons of each decision.
