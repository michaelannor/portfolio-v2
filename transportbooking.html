                <p>
                    Travel by road is the most used mode of getting from one city to another. Relatively few people use airlines 
                    to go from the South to the North and vice versa. Air travel is significantly more expensive and more convenient 
                    than using commuter coaches. A lot of the convenience has less to do with the actual modes of transport but rather 
                    the processes of organising a trip. Local airlines allow customers to book tickets online, and in advance, and are 
                    able to communicate dates and times clearly. However, with the major road transport companies, booking is typically 
                    done at the station and seats are assigned on a first come first serve basis.

                    As sa product designer, my role was to design an application that helped travellers book tickets with their 
                    preferred companies from the convenience of their phones.

                                    Targets people who use their phones for basic activities.Cut waiting time. Trying to bring activities typically performed at bus terminals by different actors to a single mobile phone meant introducing the need for a significant change in user behaviours. Travellers having become accustomed to the current way of doing this will need hand-holding to transition until the benefits are evident. Two approaches, skinning down the application to very basic feature set, simplifying the app to avoid overwhelming content. And allowing them to book on behalf of others. Riding on champions in the travel party. Favour phone numbers over emails. One action at each step.
