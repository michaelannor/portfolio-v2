        <p>This was a freelance project for a client who wanted to develop a platform to enable working 
            adults skill-up by adequately preparing for different certifications. The concentration at 
            the launch phase was on the Project Management Professional (PMP) Certification.

                <p>
                    For me, it was important to get this right because many working professionals in Ghana 
                    earn below their true earning potentials for various reasons, and I believed navigating 
                    career changes was one way to get ahead.
                </p>
                <div class="gap-20"></div>
                <p>
                    Once the concept of the application was shared with me, I spent time speaking to a number of 
                    young professionals who were working towards a career pivot. Notably, I learned there were typically 
                    two options they considered: a part-time, after-work masters program (e.g an MBA) and a certification 
                    course (e.g. ACCA, etc.). Both options were expensive and intensive, and would require late night schooling, 
                    through the hectic traffic jams in the city.
                </p>
                <div class="gap-20"></div>
                <p>
                    These experiences led us to focus on emphasizing accessibility and convenience in the tools we provided these 
                    professionals. As a result, the very first version was to be on mobile.

                <p>Working in a team of 3 (myself, a UX Researcher and the engineering lead), my role involved working with insights

                        Benefit of these through practice questions. A user can go general or select a topic to focus on, limit the session 
                        to a number of questions and run the practice. Each question comes  with an explanation. For both correct and wrong 
                        (because of try and error)... dilemma to only show explanation when wrong? To mark as you go or mark at the end. 
                        The decision was to mark as you go so even if you don’t complete the session (e.g. your trotro reached it’s destination), 
                        you learnt.

                    taken as a reminder of their hard work. Encouragement through copy after each session in presenting the score.

            “Better to practice a little everyday than a lot at the last minute.”. When life gets in the way. 
            As a Duolingo user I knew how as users we start with vim and dull out, and we considered streaks, but streaks 
            lose effect after they’re lost. So gentle reminders. Hmw have sensible reminders that aren’t annoying.
