        <h1 id="intro">Exam Preparation for Busy Professionals</h1>

        <p>This was a freelance project for a client who wanted to develop a platform to enable working 
            adults skill-up by adequately preparing for different certifications. The concentration at 
            the launch phase was on the Project Management Professional (PMP) Certification.

                <p>
                    For me, it was important to get this right because many working professionals in Ghana 
                    earn below their true earning potentials for various reasons, and I believe navigating 
                    career changes was one way to get ahead.
                </p>
                <div class="gap-20"></div>
                <p>
                    Once the concept of the application was shared with me, I spent time speaking to a number of 
                    young professionals who were working towards a career pivot. Notably, I learned there were typically 
                    two options they considered: a part-time, after-work masters program (e.g an MBA) and a certification 
                    course (e.g. ACCA, etc.). Both options were expensive and intensive, and would require late night schooling, 
                    through the hectic traffic jams in the city.
                </p>
                <div class="gap-20"></div>
                <p>
                    These experiences led us to focus on emphasizing accessibility and convenience in the tools we provided these 
                    professionals. As a result, the very first version was to be on mobile.

                <p>Working in a team of 3 (myself, a UX Researcher and the engineering lead), my role involved working with insights

                    <div class="gap-10"></div>
                    <p>
                        The learners we targeted have full-time jobs and are working on preparing for these exams in their spare 
                        time. To excel, they will have to cover a very broad pool of exercises. A few of these would get access to 
                        heavy test prep books. However many more shared PDF versions of these books with their friends, and would 
                        read through whenever they could. With these insights, we sought to understand how we could learn from the 
                        way text books and flash cards are used, to design solutions that are effective and time efficient. Through 
                        ideation, we decided to introduce a practice mode- a variant of the regular tests, that will not be timed, 
                        will give explanations after attempting each question, and free to access. In addition, we provided users with 
                        options to select interested topics, and the length of a session. A dilemma at this stage was whether to 
                        time-box a session using minutes or number of questions. The design we settled with used number questions in 
                        order to eliminate the anxieties that come with taken a timed test from the practice mode. Also, explanations 
                        came right after each question instead of at the end of the session, so that a session can be interrupted 
                        (for example, at the end of a commute) with little to lose.

                <div class="gap-10"></div>
                <p>
                    The entire prep process becomes more stressful, when learners don't feel confident. When stress piles on, they 
                    fret and it shows in their work. In learning this, we asked "how might we reinforce a learner's confidence?". 
                    This led to designing reporting features that helped users to see a cumulative assessment of their performance. 
                    Metrics include average score, number of sessions taken and top-performing topics. For this feature, it will be 
                    interesting to see how users use it, and if the metrics provided are going to be useful to them. In addition, when 
                    a test is scored, we used copywriting and icons to boost confidence by providing encouragement and celebrations.

        <p>
            We knew we needed to help users build habits around practice. Especially in understanding how busy the target 
            users were, we considered counting practice streaks, but we feared, if we built motivation around streaks, once 
            a long streak is lost, starting again is more difficult. I would have loved to test these assumptions out if the
            project had the budget. In its stead, we considered reminders through responsible push notifactions.

        <p>In addition to the mobile app, we designed a web app for administrators to manage test content on the app. The most
            challenging thing about this project, was going from user research, ideating and prototyping to usability testing on a
            limited budget. Fortunately, I was able to access a network of professionals in similar contexts to work with.
