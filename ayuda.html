                <p>
                    It’s a real difficulty, finding reliable, trustworthy artisans and workers. This client, having worked in the 
                    construction business for several years realised he could build a network of plumbers, carpenters, electricians, 
                    etc. that can be known for the quality of their work and can be trusted to deliver on time. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    My job was to design a set of experiences for <span class="highlight-text">workers</span> to receive job requests and <span class="highlight-text">consumers</span> to launch requests. 
                    The main challenge here was to foster trust i as these connections are made.

                                <div class="gap-10"></div>

                                    Ordinarily, consumers have little trust for contractors who generally have a reputation of 
                                    being unreliable with timing, pricing, etc. Our approach to bridge the trust gap on the 
                                    consumer side was multi-faceted. For starters, we introduced a feature to enable back and forth 
                                    negotiations. This ensured pricing was fair to both players. This was also to mimic the interactions 
                                    that happen during engagements like this. In addition, we introduced job ratings. Ratings here are meant 
                                    to hold workers accountable, and to rank users using data from different consumers. For ratings, we 
                                    initially considered emojis and stars. Decided on using stars because they're a more familiar metaphor 
                                    for rankings. I am however curious to the actual usage data and see how the use of the ratings feature 
                                    transforms the way consumers seek for workers. Finally, we allow consumers to log complaints- for when 
                                    ratings aren’t sufficient.

                                    Customer service is biased towards optimising for the customer's experience, sometimes, at the expense of workers. 
                                    Because workers aren't direct employees, we have to carefully craft the worker experience on the app as well. 
                                    To do this, we position the ratings as a badge of honour, instead as a score-card. This was meant to evoke positive 
                                    emotions around the ratings feature. We also designed the job requests so that consumers provide all the information 
                                    necessary (dates, descriptions, photos, etc.) for workers to make fair estimations and plan better. When there is 
                                    clarity, workers are able to deliver more reliably. In addition, workers will be trained and assisted by the Ayuda 
                                    back-office, so that the tool (mobile app) doesn't become an impediment.

            In addition to the two-sided marketplace with workers and consumers, the business included a Premium service, where 
            job requests were handled by in-house staff. This complicated the experience as the standard service and the premium 
            service were in conflict.
